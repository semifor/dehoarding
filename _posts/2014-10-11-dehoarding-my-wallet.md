title: Dehoarding my wallet

I hate fat wallets. For years, I've carried a [Coach credit card holder][1]
instead. I seldom carry cash. When I do, I just carry folded bills in my
pocket.

One problem with this minimalistic approach is access to all the other things
people carry in their fat wallets. I occasionally need access to my proof of
auto insurance card, health insurance card, retailer rewards cards, frequent
flyer membership cards, etc.

While on a short business trip this week, I used some decluttering time
to reduce the things I carry in my pocket.

I added a notebook named Wallet in [Evernote][2] and used the Evernote App's
document camera to snap photos of the cards I carry. When I got home, I
snapped pictures of several other cards I _would_ carry if I had a fat wallet.

I'm impressed with the document camera. It finds the edges of the cards and
automatically crops the image accordingly. It also lets me take a picture at
an angle—sometimes necessary to avoid glare on a glossy card—and adjusts the
resulting image from a trapezoid to a rectangle. The text and images on card
or document come out perfect.

Now, I've got the best of both worlds: access to all my fat wallet cards in
the [iPhone Evernote App][3], and an even thinner credit card holder.

Soon, I'll replace that credit card holder with something even more
minimal.

I jumped on the [Kickstarter Panel project][4] and I'm awaiting
delivery.  The Panel is just a thin card, slightly longer than a credit
card and wider than folded currency, with an elastic band. Put credit
cards on one side, folded currency on the other. It suites my minimalist
style. I could have made one myself, but decided to reward the idea with
my support.

I also jumped on the [Coin project][5] and I'm awaiting delivery of my Coin
[Just checked—delayed until Spring, 2015—argh!].  It's a computer, the size
and shape of a credit card with a magnetic strip. It comes with a card reader
that plugs into your smart phone. Scan all your credit, debit, and membership
cards with magnetic strips. Then, just carry that single card! It works in ATM
machines and credit card scanners. It has a tiny LCD display and a single
integrated, pressure sensitive button so you can toggle through your cards and
select the one you want to use.

So, soon, I'll be carrying just a single credit/debit card, the key card
that gets me into the office, my [ORCA card][10] for transportation in
Seattle, all strapped to a thin piece of plastic in my pocket. With that
and my iPhone, I'll have everything I need without the back problems and
mess of a fat wallet.

I took a book with me to Seattle and gave it to a coworker, [David
Weiser][9]. He's a history buff. Last week, he posted a link on Facebook
to an article I really enjoyed, [The NSA and me][6], by [James
Bamford][7].

On the bookshelf behind my desk, I had a copy of Bamford's [The Puzzle
Palace][8] referenced in the article. So, I took it with me as a gift
for David. One more great book has a new home.
