On the heels of the [water bottle de-hoarding][bottles] success, we
tackled the coffee cup cupboard. Same problem. Gifts, souveneirs,
chipped favorites. Mugs with broken handles inside, waiting to be
repaired. That never happens. Ever! Right?

So, we picked about 5, and I kept my favorite travel mug---I have a
handy handlebar mounted holder for it, even!---and we recovered a few
more square feet of cupboard space!

There are some great mugs that'll end up as gifts and take up space in
SOMEBODY ELSE'S cupboard!

## Discarded
- 3 coffee cups/mugs

### Donated
- 16 coffee cups and travel mugs
