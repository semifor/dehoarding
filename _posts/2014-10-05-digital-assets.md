I spent much of the weekend working on this blog. I never wanted to spend much
time managing it, working on themes and style sheets, etc. It was supposed to
be a place to drop quickly created content with minimal fuss.

Problems with the site I was using prompted a change. The current solution is
still fairly light weight. I'm using [Github pages][1] to host my blog with
minor modifications (so far) to a [Jekyll][2] layout.

This solution has the benefit of being extremely solid. Github isn't going
away any time soon. If the site goes down, I know it will get immediate
attention. My blog is just along for the ride on one of the worlds most active
web sites.

The distributed nature of [git][3], means I can easily have multiple backup
copies of my contents, so if disaster does happen, I can recover.

Initially, I thought this blog would just be some simple notes with little
value to me. But it may actually be an important archive with notes about the
things I'm parting with forever preserved. So, it makes sense to give some
thought to the stability and security of my digital assets.
