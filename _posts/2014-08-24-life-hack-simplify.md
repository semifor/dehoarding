I decided to start throwing stuff out, donating it, listing it on
[Craigslist][craigslist] and [eBay][ebay] until I've gotten rid of all the
clutter in my life. I started last Friday, I think. I told [Dave
Trimmer][trimmer] about it today over lunch, and he suggested I keep a list of
everything I throw out. Might make a great blog post or story someday, he
says.

Rather than try to remember each day, I'm just going to do a single
catch up entry, today, and try to keep up going forward.

### Discarded
- about 30 old magazines
- about 10 pair of socks
- 2 old cell phones

- couple old ball caps
- couple of empty prescription bottles (my Walgreens app will tell me
what they wereâ€”no need to save them for reference)

### Donated
