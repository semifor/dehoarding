Thinned and culled my side of the closet. In the process, discarded a
couple of old Under Armor T-shirts the prompted a story I posted on
Medium, also titled [Closet full of stories][medium-closet]. Go read it!

### Discarded:
- several pair of briefs
- 2 Under Armor T-shirts
- terrycloth headband and wrist band (so 80s!)
- 1 pair of bike shorts

### Donated
- 7 button down shirts
- 12 T-shirts
- 1 long sleeve high-tech shirt
- 1 pair of blue jeans
- 16 silk ties
- 1 very nice fanny pack (who the hell where's a fanny pack?)
