I competed in an Ironman Triathlon in 2006. It remains one of my
proudest accomplishments. My son, Chris, spent the day volunteering on
the course. He was working as a "catcher" at the finish line when I came
in. And he hung the Ironman medal around my neck. That was a
particularly special moment.

My finisher's T-shirt has been hanging in the closet for years. I
thought it would make a great gift for Chris, so I mailed it to him
today and sent him an email about it.

Accompanied Jenny to a doctor's appointment today and left a book with a
[BookCrossing][bc] sticker in the waiting room.
