Pro tip: If you're going to de-hoard, do it quietly.

Newspaper reporters are on the hunt for stories. If you have friends who
attend social functions with these reporters, your de-hoarding [story
could end up in the newspaper][1], complete with a picture of a goofy
expression on your face and the shameful mess that is your garage. It
happened to me.

Oh well, there's still plenty of work to do.

I took a day off from work and from de-hoarding to celebrate my
granddaughter's sixth birthday. Don't lose track of the important things
in life. I'm not going to.

Then, after making her an egg, Canadian bacon, and English muffin
sandwich for breakfast and walking her to school, grab an empty cardboard
box and fill it with nick-knacks, games, and puzzles. Drop it by
Goodwill, and declare the project goal satisfied.

### Donated ###
- various games
- various puzzles
- nick-knacks from Hawaii and other places that really should have
  stayed there
