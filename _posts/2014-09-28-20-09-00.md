When each child grows up and leaves home it means another closet to take
over. This serves two purposes. First it ensures no space for them to
return to---a guard against rebound. Second it provides a place to store a
bunch of clothes you won't admit you'll never wear again.

This weekend I tackled one of those closets and the coat closet in the
kitchen. Yes we have a coat closet in the kitchen. It's a weird early
seventies floor plan.

### Donated
- 15 pairs of pants
- 34 shirts
- 5 jackets

### Discarded
- 1 fleece jacket, sleeves cut off\*

### Gifted
- [Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman][1] to Jacob Johnson for his birthday

\*The sleeves are zip-tied to the handlebars of the Trail-a-Bike.  Izzy,
our five year old granddaughter, can slip her hands inside to keep them
warm while riding. I have no idea why I saved the mangled, sleeveless,
donor jacket.
