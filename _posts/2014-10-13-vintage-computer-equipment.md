Do you laugh when you hear _vintage_ and _computer_ in the same
sentence? I do too. But if there is such a thing, I have it. My
introduction to computers was a punch card system when I was in grade
school and my dad was attending the Colorado School of Mines. I was
fascinated!

Next, it was programmable HP calculators. Somewhere, I have some of my
dad's old HP calculators. I'll find them, eventually.

Then there was the Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I. I still have it! Complete
with the original line printer, purpose built desk, dust covers,
manuals, and even a fancy 300 baud acoustic coupled modem!

300 baud! I remember using the Dow Jones News Retrieval Service and
Compuserve with it. I could read as fast as the characters appeared on
the screen! Imagine that the next time you're streaming an HD movie.
Or, imagine if downloading a book to your Kindle took longer than
reading it! That's 300 baud.

If they'll have it, I intend to donate the TRS-80 to the [Living
Computer Museum][1]. I need to get them some good photos.

The most recent surprise was learning that my 1987 IBM Model M Keyboard,
which is about three times as heavy as the laptop computer I'm typing
this on, is a collectible, highly desirable item. A rare, new in-box
Model M sells for $600 or more! There's even a [website dedicated to
these classic keyboards][3].

I listed mine on ebay. I'll let you know how much it brings when the
auction closes next week.

It came with the IBM PS/2 Model 60 that was my primary computer for a
year or two.

Now, if I can just sell the Compaq Prolinea MT 4/66 for what I paid...
