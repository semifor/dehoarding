As part of my decluttering process, I'm going paperless. Did I mention
that before?

Our paper filing system is simple and efficient. January first, every
year, we start a new file box. One of the simple file folder boxes you
can buy at any office supply store. We write the year on five of the six
sides (if it's upside down, we've got bigger problems than figuring out
which year it's for). All year long, we toss our receipts in the box. If
the IRS auditor ever comes knocking, we can just grab the file box and
start digging.

I've always figured there's no use doing any more filing than that. Yes,
it means that if we do get an audit, we'll have to sort through the
receipts and organize. But if we don't get audited, there's no wasted
energy.

There are some problems with this process.

- When we do have to go find a receipt, it's hard, frustrating, and time
  consuming.
- We should be discarding these boxes when we hit the seven year mark. It
  is seven years, right? I dunno, so to be safe, we don't discard.
- Year end transition is a bitch. Does it go in the new box or the old
  box?
- Did we put anything in the annual receipts box that really should be
  kept permanently? Another reason we don't discard them. But holly
  hell! What a messy project if we have to find something we tossed into
  an annual box and we don't know which one!

[Evernote][1] to the rescue! Scan it. Discard or shred it.

For reimbursable expenses, I'm tagging with two tags: year, and month.
And storing them in the Expensify notebook.

[Expensify][2] is an online app that integrates with Evernote and
lets me prepare a nicely formatted expense report, creating a PDF with
all my receipts in the proper order.

All other receipts are just tagged with the year and stored in the
receipts notebook.

When I have seven years of receipts in Evernote, I'll be able to select
and delete all the receipts older than that.

Signing up for paper statements, where possible, is the next step. But
its the most problematic for me. I **HATE** that companies save the cost
of postage, paper, and envelopes, when I go paperless and don't share
any of that cost savings with me. And I hate it even more when they make
getting my paperless statement ten times harder than getting the printed
copy by mail.

Take note, utility, mortgage, and credit card companies! If you want your
customers to go paperless, email a PDF statement! Don't make us go online
every month, find and enter our user IDs and passwords, navigate your
crazy menus, and print a statement to PDF. You're saving cash and
causing us time and frustration. Just email us the damned statements!

So, until the companies I do business with get the message, I'm going to
get paper statements as a *reminder* to download and save to Evernote
my digital statements. Then I'll toss the paper statements in the
recycle bin along with the unopened junk mail.

When I check the mail, I scan the important mail using the Evernote
document camera on my iPhone and then toss everything, including the
unopened junk mail in the recycle bin.

I may get a [Snapscan][3] scanner, but for now, the iPhone app works
just fine.

As I gain more experience and have time to test the process, I'll have
more to report.

Until then, let me answer Jenny's snide remark:

> So, you're in Seattle. What are you going to get rid of today?

I came prepared.
