Two weeks ago, I gave a copy of Joseph Heller's [God Knows][1] to a
friend. I discovered her favorite book is [Catch-22][2], which has long
been my favorite, and I wanted to share another of his works with her
that I enjoyed.

So, when I received an anonymous gift in the mail, Martin Gardener's
[The Flight of Peter Fromm][3], I though she must have sent it.

She didn't. Neither did her husband. And it was beginning to freak me
out a little bit. Why? Because I read that book thirty years ago during
a very transformative period of my life. That book was instrumental.

Someone either knew I'd read that book long ago, even though I'd
forgotten about it myself, or they'd read it themselves and had enough
insight into my mind to know it would move me.

Turns out, it was both. My friend [Russell Durtschi][4] sent it.

We'd both read it thirty years ago. And I did, in fact think of Russell
when considering who might have sent it. But I'd forgotten that we both
read it. Also, Russell is quite religious and had always tried to steer
me toward faith, not away. I remember the book being instrumental in the
process of abandoning faith, so I couldn't imagine Russell sending it.

He clearly has a better memory than mine. He remembers we both read it.
He remembers I found it faith eroding while he found it faith affirming.
And he remembers we had some great, deep discussions in the months and
years surrounding our reading of it.

If I listed the five most influential books in my life, this one would
be on that list. Yet, I'd forgotten it. While setting up my
[Goodreads][5] list, I hadn't remembered it. Last week, if you'd asked
me to make a short list of those books, I wouldn't have recalled it.

And that's what causes me at least a little anxiety as I part with my
possessions. I've written about it before. Memory is frail enough without
tangible crutches. I'm busy disposing of those crutches. How will I
recall the events, people, and places that are important to me without
them?

In part, I'm creating digital crutches---pictures of the items I discard
and sell. I'm also making some notes and writing here so I can come back
later and refresh my memory.

Today, the eBay auction closed on the vintage, 1987 IBM clackety Model M
keyboard. It ships tomorrow. Even it holds memories. When our oldest son
was just seven or eight years old, he'd watch me work on the computer.
"Dad, can I tick on the computer?" he'd ask. I'd let him sit at the
computer and type in a text editor. He loved it. The clackety sound that
keyboard made added a term to our family lexicon. To this day, when
someone else wants to use the computer, whether it's a laptop, desktop,
tablet, or smart phone, they say, "Hey, can I tick on the computer?"
