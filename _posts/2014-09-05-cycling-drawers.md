I have three dresser drawers stuffed full of biking, running, and
swimming gear. This morning I went through one drawer at a time, dumped
the contents on the bed and tossed back in the items I actually use, or
definitely will use---some if it is seasonal.

Here's where the rest went:

### Discarded
- 12 pairs of socks
- 1 pair of gloves
- 4 bandannas
- 1 jersey
- 1 2008 STP jacket
- 9 pairs of cycling shorts
- 4 pairs of compression shorts
- 1 pair of tri shorts
- 1 pair gym shorts
- 1 pair neoprene bicycle shoe covers (worn out!)
- 2 REI microfiber towel bags
- various straps---must be to gear bags

### Donated
- 7 pairs of cycling socks (3 new)
- 1 pair of socks for swimming fins (new)
- 1 pair of mountain bike shorts
- 1 pair of running shorts
- 1 pair of running tights
- 2 Under Armor skull caps
- 1 head sweat (new)
- 1 cycling jersey (new)
- 2 gear bags
- 1 ankle strap (for cycling)

### Gifted
- 1 Moz hoodie XL (family)

## Memories

I had the cycling jersey, tags intact, for nearly 20 years.  It was
purchased as a Christmas gift for the owner of a company I managed with
money pooled by coworkers. He later gave it to me.  I never felt good
about that. Donating it seems right.

The STP jacket is from my one and only [Seattle to Portland][stp] ride
in 2008. Jenny and I did the ride with group of friends. I rode in a
pace line that included John Martinek, Steve Waco, Dave Shill, Mark
Lord, and a couple others whose names I don't recall.
