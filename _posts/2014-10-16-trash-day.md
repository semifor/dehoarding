Tomorrow is trash day. Those trucks roll early, so every Thursday
night, Jenny says, "You know what tonight is, right?"

That's my queue to empty the bathroom and kitchen trash cans and hall
the garbage container to the curb.

Given the current project, I fist make sure there's not a single cubic
inch of empty space before I haul it out for pick up. Jenny pointed me
to the bench at the far corner of the garage, "If you want to throw
stuff away, start there."

### Discarded ###
- half a bicycle inner tube
- a whole bicycle inner tube, in the box, condition unknown
- old rubber hoses to automobiles no longer owned
- dusty dirty rags
- a broken plastic model airplane
- bunch of wire, string, tape, glue, and plastic
- Styrofoam packing for something oval, your guess is as good as mine
- a broken, plastic pencil sharpener

I've also spent some time researching a few things I can list on auction
sites or Craigslist. No spoilers. I'll write about them when they leave
the premises.
