Spent my dehoarding time today working on a blog. This blog. Decided it
would be fun to do a short, daily, blog entry about the things I
discard, donate, gift, and release.

With my new found love for [Evernote][evernote], I decided to give
[postach.io][postach.io] a try. But quickly decided Evernote sucks at
plain text and [Markdown][md]. So I tried their other option--[Dropbox][db]
integration. The OAuth redirect 404-ed. I don't think
postach.io is mature, yet.

So, I spent the evening---a long evening that ended in the wee hours of
the morning---working with [Jekyll and Github pages][jekyll-gh].

I'm backfilling, now. It's actually Saturday, the 6th as I write this.
I've since gotten postach.io's Dropbox integration set up, and I'm
thinking I'll use that. I just need to modify the front matter on all
these posts and push them up to [Dropbox][db].
