My friends are growing suspicious. When I show up to dinner, my
messenger bag is loaded with books, magazines, jerseys---things to give
away. My declutter is their new clutter.

But they're getting some great books to ready, and I've registered them
with [BookCrossing.com][1], so they can just pass them on when they're
done.

### Gifted
- Red Bull Magazine (Bob Johnson)
- cycling jersey (Bob Johnson)
- cycling jersey (Frank Ping)

### Released
- [Lucy: the Beginnings of Humankind][2] (Cathy Johnson)
- [The White Spider][3] (Cathy Harris)
- [Chi Running][4] (Joe Johnson)

The jersey I gave Frank is actually one he and Sheila gave me! It was a
birthday or Christmas gift. When I was an XL. I'm an L, now, and I'm not
going back! I'm dehoarding body fat, too!
