Home from Seattle. Tomorrow's trash pickup day. So, I did some junk
mining in the garage. It's a rich mine!

### Discarded
- Massive plastic cover for the sofa
- espresso maker (broken)
- space heater (broken)

### Recycled
- several cardboard boxes
- 2 more bicycle water bottles (we got new ones at [Spokefest][1])
