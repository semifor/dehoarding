Busy work day. Barely left the home office, so I didn't venture out
anywhere with books to release. I spent about an hour shredding
documents I'd scanned, getting the trash out to the curb for pickup
tomorrow, and tearing down empty boxes in the garage.

It's amazing how many empty boxes we have stashed in the garage. Most
are for computers, printers, monitors, and small appliances---things you
hang on to the boxes for in case you need to return them or send them in
for warranty repair.

Those warranties are long expired. The computers, monitors, and printers
are gone. Now the boxes are gone, too. Or, rather, ready for the
recycling pickup three weeks from now. They'll have to wait that long
because the next pickup is next week, and the big recycle dumpster is
already full and waiting. I'm now filling up secondary trash cans in
advance!

### Discarded
- 8 twenty-five year old Tupperware glasses

### Recycled
- ~20 cardboard boxes
