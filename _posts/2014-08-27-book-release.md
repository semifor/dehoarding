I've got a lot of books. I love my books. I love my [Kindle][kindle].
Truth is, I rarely reread a book. And in the age of the big bit bucket
in the sky we call the cloud, I can carry an entire library in my
pocket. If I lose it, I get another reader and squeeze a few hundred
books out of the cloud. I can reclaim a lot of shelf space. Eventually,
maybe even get rid of some book cases!

A few years ago, I got enamoured with [BookCrossing.com][bk], a site
dedicated to "releasing" books "in the wild" and tracking where they go.
The site's not well done, really. It's slow. And I don't think I've ever
had anyone register one of the books I've released---even the ones I've
given to friends, putting my finger on the little BookCrossing sticker
and demanding, "Go to this site! Enter this number!"

But what the heck. I've got a bunch of stickers and leaving books laying
around in some public place doesn't cost me anything. Doesn't fill up my
garbage can or recycle bin. And who knows, my books might make some
other people happy. Or smarter. Or more confused. Don't look a gift
horse in the mouth!

I traveled to Seattle today, so I released a couple of books in places
where you aren't supposed to leave any unattended items. I'm a rebel!
