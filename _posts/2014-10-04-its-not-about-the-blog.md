title: It's not about the blog!

It's not supposed te be about the blog! It's supposed to be about the process
of decluttering, paring down my possessions, and the stories it inspires.

I wanted a dead simple log. Write in [Markdown][1], drop it in a [Dropbox][2]
synced folder, done! But I can't seem to find a site that does reliably. So,
that might mean writing my own blogging system. Which seems such a waste.
Every programming tutorial out there features a blog, it seems. How hard can
it be? *Famous last words.*

Yesterday evening, I took a set of books to friend Cathy Harris. They're
cycling murder mysteries. I used to have the whole set, bet one book, [Two
Wheels][3] is missing. The first in the series, I think.

This morning, I spent some time in the basement discarding some empty computer
component boxes. They were stashed on top of some book shelves. I intended to
discard them when the warranty period on those items was up. Safe to say it's
up, now!

I also sorted through some more books. I've got an entire bookcase loaded with
books to sell, now. If next Saturday is supposed to be nice, I may have my
first driveway book sale.
