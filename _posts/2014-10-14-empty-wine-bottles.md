If Jenny reads my blog, I'm a dead man. So don't tell her about it! You
see, I had a long, mentally exhausting work day, and I don't feel like
doing any hard decluttering work. So, I tossed her stash of seven empty
wine bottles into the recycle bin. Done!

Why were there seven empty wine bottles stashed in the garage? She read
about this interesting craft project, bought a special glass cutting
kit, and decided to make out-door candle covers as gifts for friends.
She collected seven (so far) bottles with unique shapes and colors with
he intent of cutting the bottoms out and polishing the cut edges.

That was months ago. I don't know when, or if, she'll find the
motivation to complete that project. So, I discarded the bottles that
were just clutter. Without asking. I live dangerously.

If there's a market for half finished craft projects, or just barely
started craft projects, we could open a store.

As far is _this_ project is concerned, if she decides to complete it, I
don't think we'll have any trouble enlisting the help of friends and
producing seven more empty wine bottles on short notice. You've got my
back on this, right?
