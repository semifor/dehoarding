How do you know when you know you're Craigslist post is priced too low? Fast
and furious response. Sold a set of four studded snow tires to a guy from
Coeur d'Alene. Well, three guys in a red car. They called twice: first to see
if I still had the tires. A second time to let me know they were on the way
and traffic was bad. And while on the phone with them, I missed a call and
answered an email. Oh, well. They got a deal and I reclaimed the space those
tires took up for the past six years!

We'd gone to Colorado for my brother's wedding our 250,000 mile Honda Accord
Wagon. The transmission died while we were there. We left it, flew home, and
bought a Volkswagen Jetta. When winter came, we had studded snow tires---wrong
size for the Jetta. So, there they sat in the garage for six years.

Gone!

The other day, while going through my books, I found a naked picture of my
dad. For real! OK. So, he was two when it was taken. Still, it makes a good
story. Check out my post on Medium, [Keys to my lost memories][1]
