I sent an email this morning to our three adult children. Subject:
_Abandoned Property Notice_. In the email, I let them know that part of
my decluttering project is getting rid of the stacks of boxes of their
stuff. Stuff they left at home when they moved out. Stuff they stashed
here when they returned from college. Stuff they stashed here when they
moved from one place to another and needed a _temporary_ place to store
a few things.

Based on what I've learned so far, I offered a couple of suggestions:

1. Decide in advance how much stuff you want to keep. Maybe just one
   file box. Then, when you sort through it, stick to the plan. Just
   one box full. Find something you just have to have, but the box is
   full? Remove something from the box to make room.

2. Get an [Evernote][1] or [Flickr][2] account. Or both. They're free.
   Use your mobile phone to take snapshots of cards, awards, mementos.
   Preserve the memories with digital images you can view any time.
   Discard the actual objects that will otherwise sit in a box in a
   basement---just not _my_ basement.

[Pia Hallenberg][7] interviewed me at lunch time, today. Watch for a
story in the [Spokesman Review][8]. She heard about my decluttering
project and thinks it will make an interesting story. She'll have to
apply her writing skills to make a garage full of worthless books and
empty boxes entertaining.

I also closed my first [ebay][3] sale in ages. I used ebay years ago,
mostly to acquire stuff that sits in boxes in the basement. Now I'm
reversing the process. Wow! It has really changed. It's much easier than
I remembered.

I sold an HP-12C calculator. After entering the description, ebay filled
in most of the details. They certainly know all about HP-12C
calculators. When the sale ended, I immediately had cash in my
[Paypal][4] account. Ebay sold me the postage. All I had to do was print
a packing slip and shipping label that included postage, and box up the
calculator and manual. Couldn't possibly be any easier.

Jenny wondered why I got rid of my favorite calculator. Well, I have
this:

![HP-12C app][5]

Looks like an HP-12C, right? It is. And it isn't. It's the [HP-12C
iPhone App][6]. Who needs the actual calculator when you've got one in
your pocket wherever you go!

Actually, I have another HP-12C. I'll likely sell that one, too. Like
I've said, I've got too much stuff.

### Discarded ###
- 4 phone books (Don't tell Jenny---she'll never notice they're gone)
- more empty boxes that belong to long gone computer components

### Sold ###
- 1 HP-12C calculator, $21.73
