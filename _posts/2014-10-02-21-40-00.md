title: Less Christmas frustration

Trash day. I topped off the garbage can with huge pile of Christmas
lights. Every year, Jenny drags them out onto the living room floor and
spends hours hunting for that one bad light. Eventually, she gives up,
throws the heap of tangled light strings back into a box and hides them
in the basement for another year.

No more! Now, if I can convince her not to buy replacements...

### Discarded ###
- 12 strings of Christmas lights

In other news, I think I need a different blogging service. I like
[Postach.io][1]'s concept. I'm using [Dropbox][2] integration. Write a
post in [Markdown][3] and drop it in a particular Dropbox folder
and--Shazam!--it's a web post. If it only worked, reliably.

Last night's post is perfectly valid Markdown. Nothing unusual about it
at all. But all that shows up is the title and date. The long post isn't
displayed. Prior to this problem, there were long delays where posts
didn't appear, a duplicate post even though there was just one copy of
it in the folder, images not appearing in new posts, images disappearing
from old posts, then reappearing days later.

I tried [Tumblr][4], posting in Markdown via email. But my second post
was mangled. I deleted it, reposted. Still mangled. I used their editor,
copied and pasted the exact same Markdown content, and in rendered
properly.

Doesn't anyone have a simple email or Dropbox integrated Markdown
blogging solution *that works*?
