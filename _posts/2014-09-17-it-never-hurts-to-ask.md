I must have have 50 [O'Reilly][1] books. I love them. I've read every
one, cover to cover. At any time in the past 10 years or so, I've had at
least one, maybe two in my pack making the rounds to work and back with
me.

But after I've devoured them, they mostly collect dust. Occasionally, I
pull one off the shelf and re-read a chapter, or use one for reference.
An online search is generally sufficient, now, though.

On a whim, I sent an email to O'Reilly. If, I asked, I donate all my
O'Reilly books to my local high school, would you be willing to support
my in that effort by giving me the ebook versions of my ten favorites?

It never hurts to ask! I got an email back this morning accepting that
offer. So, on my lunch break I stopped by the high school and got the
name and email address of a teacher who should be interested. Just
waiting to hear back.

This will free up a bunch of shelf space and make my ten favorite titles
more accessible to me. It's going to be a big win!

Otherwise, it was an exceptionally light dehoarding day. Left one book at
Subway where I had lunch. Before I'd even ordered, one of the staff saw
the book and set it aside. I'm sure she thought someone left it by
mistake and didn't even notice the BookCrossing sticker on the front.

Oh, well, someone will eventually notice.
