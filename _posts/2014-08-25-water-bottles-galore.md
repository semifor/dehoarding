title: Water bottles galore
date: 2014-08-25

I've already filled up the trash can, so I decided to focus on stuff I can put
in the recycle bin.

Water bottles.

Every cyclists' home has a cupboard full of water bottles.  Every time we do a
new event we get new water bottles until that cupboard has nothing but water
bottles, and jamming another one in causes a door to pop open on the other
side and three fall out.

So, I told Jenny, "Our bikes each have two water bottle cages. That means on
any ride we can take four. Double that. Let's keep our best eight water
bottles.

We discarded thirty-eight water bottles! Thirty-eight! And a bunch of plastic
travel cups.

We've got a few really nice water bottles with tags still on them.  Insulated.
Or special fancy valves. We set those aside to give away.

I also tossed three beautiful [Rogue Ales][rogue] beer bottles. Those labels
are art! But this isn't a frat house. And they qualified for the recycle bin.
So out!

And I did add one thing to the over-stuffed garbage can: The pair of cycling
gloves I've been wearing damned near every ride for the past three seasons.
They fit. There my favorite brand/style. Every time in the past two years I've
tried to replace them, the local bike shop didn't have the style or size I
wanted. So, I hung on the this disintegrating pair.

But the other day, while going through the drawers I keep my cycling gear in,
I found a BRAND NEW pair. Never worn. Right size. Right style.  Wrong color.
Screw color! I ride a purple bike for hell's sake. What does color matter?

### Discarded
- 1 pair of worn out bike gloves
- 38 water bottles and several plastic cups, mugs, etc.
- 3 [Rogue Ales][rogue] beer bottles
