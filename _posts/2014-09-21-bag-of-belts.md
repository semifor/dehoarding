No post yesterday. The only dehoarding I did then was body fat. I did
[140 miles of bike riding][1], the first ninety between midnight and 5:30am.
That experience deserves it's own post. Working on it.

Today, I went through the two overflow dresser drawers I've been using in
April's old room. I stuffed my messenger bag full and made a donation at
Goodwill.

### Donated
- 2 pairs of convertible hiking pants/shorts
- 3 pairs of pajama bottoms
- 4 pains of shorts
- 7 bets
- 1 handkerchief
