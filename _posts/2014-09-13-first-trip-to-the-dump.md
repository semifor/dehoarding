title: First trip to the dump

Hauled 340 pounds of crap to the dump. It's embarrassing how this stuff accumulates. It gets set aside because it isn't convenient to discard at the time. Maybe the trash can is full, or we think we might just need it later, or I or Jenny isn't quite sure which one of us is responsible for some item and don't want to throw it out without permission.

Jenny has long wanted a pickup truck just for hauling yard waste and crap to the dump. I'm opposed. I don't want a vehicle and all it's associated cost sitting idle ninety-nine percent of the time. 

Without a dump going rig, we have to be more diligent about getting trash there instead of letting it accumulate in the garage. 

Also, listed a couple items on Craigslist. We'll see what comes of that.

The crib. *Sigh*. Good as new. Helped a friend move for the umpteenth time. They had a crib that hadn't really been used. A nice one. Our first grandchild was on the way. "Sure! We'd like to have it," I said, thinking it was fair payment for a long day of back aching work. 

"One-hundred dollars," was the response.

I forked over the cash not wanting to show my surprise. 

Months later when it was time to set up the crib, we discovered we hadn't gotten all the hardware. It was never found. So, it sat in a corner of the basement. Until...

[Drop-side cribs were banned][1] in 2010. We couldn't give it away, sell it, donate it, or use it, even if we could find a source for the missing hardware.

So it continued to sit in the basement prompting pangs of frustration every time we saw it. 

No more. I was happy to see it gone.
