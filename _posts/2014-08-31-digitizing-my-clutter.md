Today's decluttering was mostly digital. I tried [Evernote][evernote]
briefly two or three years ago and it didn't catch on. But now I've
installed it on the laptop and iPhone and discovered its document
camera. Awesome! No more paper receipts. I snap a picture then toss them
in the recycle bin or the paper shredder.

[Flickr][flickr] now offers 1 terabyte of storage for free accounts.
I've been using the [iPhone app][flickr-app] to automatically store photos I take on
my phone. I turned off the "Save snapshots" option in the [Evernote
iPhone app][evernote-app] so pictures of receipts and documents don't
clutter my camera roll and [Flickr stream][flickr-stream].

Both Flickr and Evernote email addresses associated with accounts. You
can forward email to those addresses to have attachments saved. I did
that today with some photos a friend sent that have been neglected in my
inbox.
