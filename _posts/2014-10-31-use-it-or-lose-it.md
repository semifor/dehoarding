I've grown conscious of even the littlest decluttering tasks. The other
morning, I was getting ready to jump in the shower and noticed I needed
a new bar of soap. But wait! Under the sink I've got a big bottle of
body wash I received as a Christmas gift last year. I'm not a body wash
sorta guy, so I'd never opened it.

But hey! Use it or lose it, I thought! Here's an opportunity to get rid
of one small bit of clutter. So, instead of opening a new bar of soap, I
luxuriated in body wash. Not half bad! It's [Every Man Jack signature
mint][1]. I'll go back to plain old [Ivory Soap][2] when it's gone. And
I'll have one less bottle under the sink.

I used another technique this week to reduce my possessions by one. It
was completely effortless! No planning, no shipping, ab-so-lute-ly no
effort at all!

I lost my favorite hat. Left it at a restaurant, I think.

At first, I thought: I need to find it---retrace my steps---remember
where I left it and go get it!

Then I changed my mind. I've got more hats. I have one head. I don't
need to find it! So, I'm wearing a new hat that's been sitting on the
top shelf in the closet for ages. Before long, it will be my favorite
hat. I hope I forget it somewhere!
