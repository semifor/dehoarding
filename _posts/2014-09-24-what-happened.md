Travel day. So I did the simplest thing possible. Left a book on a seat
at the airport terminal.

I hope someone finds this book! Catch-22 is one of my all-time
favorites. So, I've tried to read Joseph Heller's other books. I just
couldn't get through this one. Tried two or three times.

Hope someone reads it and tells me how it ends!
