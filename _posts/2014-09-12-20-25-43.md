Easy pickings tonight. I've got a place in the corner of the basement where I've hung old bicycle tires and tubes. The tubes just need patched. And the tires are worn but they'll do on a pinch---like when you've shredded a good tire and the bike shop is closed. 

I *never* do that! Sure I *could* patch those tubes. But I don't, and won't, even if I should. I have several brand new tires, too. So who am I kidding? If I shred a tire and the bike shop is closed, I'm going to put *new* tires on. 

Good intentions or not, the tires and tubes are just clutter. Gone!

## Discarded
- 5 bike tires
- 11 inner tubes
- 2 pair of [Yaktrax][1], worn and mud encrusted
