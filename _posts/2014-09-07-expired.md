Today's effort was weak. But I'm tired. I towed a 5 year old 44 miles on
a Trail-a-Bike for the seventh annual Spokefest ride.

I prepared three books for a BookCrossing release, so they'll be posted
soon (probably tomorrow).

To fulfill my commitment, I went through the master bath cabinets.

### Discarded
- shaving lotion I don't use and don't like
- bunch of expired over-the-counter meds
- empty bottles and containers
- 2 suction cup hooks Jenny bought; they never did work anyway
