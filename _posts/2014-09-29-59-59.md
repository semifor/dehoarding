Tonight, I coaxed Jenny into the basement. It wasn't easy. Saturday
morning, she ran a 25K, mountainous trail run---the [Wild Moose
Chase][5]. She's so sore, she can't walk up and down stairs without
ooching and ouching. But the threat of throwing away her crap to get to
my crap was enough to do it.

We filled up the garbage can. The recycle bin was already brim full.
We've got enough to fill it again as soon as it's emptied.

I swear, if she buys one more roll of Christmas wrapping paper, I'm going
to kill her. If you find her, eyes bulging, tongue hanging out, with
ten yards of bright red ribbon wrapped around her neck, book me on [48
Hours][6]. I lost it!
