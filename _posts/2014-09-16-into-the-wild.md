Accompanied Jenny to the dentist this morning and left a book in the
waiting room. Gave Jason another when he stopped by this afternoon. He's
studying design and might find it useful.

I cleaned up a big stack of paper on my desk. Everything got scrapped or
scanned, then scrapped.

I keep hovering over the Buy button on the [ScanSnap Evernote
Edition][3]. I've got a lot of things to scan, but I'd like to sell a
few things to cover the cost of the scanner, first.
