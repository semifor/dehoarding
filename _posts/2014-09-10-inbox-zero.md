I'm still in Seattle, so my dehoarding options are limited.

I cleaned out my messenger bag. For over a year, I've been carrying
three Seattle City passes thinking I'd be able to use the Argosy cruise
tickets. But no---they expired after nine days.

Removing digital clutter is a priority, too. I've been using
[Mailbox.app][1] for some time in my iPhone. Today, I received an
invitation to the OS X beta and installed the app on my laptop. It's an
interesting mail app that encourages an empty inbox. Archive or
reschedule email messages to keep your inbox free of clutter.

For email that I includes important information I want to keep
permanently, I'm using the [Evernote web clipper][2]. I'd really like to
have some integration with Mailbox.app and Evernote so I don't have to
use the web based Gmail client to clip my emails.

Today, I also tackled some digital clutter in the way of calendar
alerts. It's gotten unbearable! Before a meeting, I've been getting
multiple alerts on my laptop and iPhone. Some alerts send a banner
massage, some pop open the calendar. I get simultaneous audible alerts
on my iPhone and laptop. I don't know where they all originate.

So, I installed [Sunrise Calendar][3] and disabled notifications on both
the iCalendar app and Google calendar. So far, so good. I'll give this
setup some time to settle and see how it works.

I'm looking forward to discovering new tools and integrations to remove
the clutter and keep it at bay. Forward your suggestions my way!

### Discarded
- 3 expired Seattle City passes
- a bunch of SEOmoz business cards
- some damaged stickers I'd been saving (before they were damaged)
