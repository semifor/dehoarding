Jenny had a stack of landscaping blocks stacked in the corner of the
backyard. Big heavy blocks. I listed them on Craigslist three times,
dropping the price each time until, at $1 each I finally got an
inquiry: "How many blocks?" Fifteen.

But no takers.

So, last night, I reposted with a new, low price: FREE!

I also added, "Please don't call before 8 AM."

When I woke this morning, I had two email messages. "I live in Mica,
just five minutes up the road. I'll be at your place at eight." By the
time he arrived, I'd also gotten a phone call.

Free is an attractive price!

A couple showed up, as promised and loaded the blocks into the back of a
Jeep Cherokee until the springs went flat and the nose was pointed
straight up. Not sure how they could see where they were going!

Bonus! They spotted a stack of red bricks in the other corner of the
yard and asked if we wanted to get rid of them. I check with the boss,
"Hell yeah!" she said, "I've been trying to get rid of those for years."

So the couple made a second trip and we've rid ourselves of about a ton
of junk. Hooyah!

Also in email this morning was an inquiry from eBay. I removed
the five batteries from Dad's old Geiger counter and listed them.

> If I win the bid, can I PayPal you on November 19th when my disability
> check comes?

This caused some head scratching. Strange. I said: thanks for the
inquiry, but no special arrangements. In the best case, the buyer will
find some more old batteries to bid on when the disability check comes.
In the worst case, it was a scam. I dunno.
