Traveled to Seattle this morning. Left one book at the Spokane
International Airport, C concourse. Left the other in the seat-back
pocket on the Spokane to Seattle flight.

I keep wondering when the [TSA][3] is going to register one of my books,
with a citation for leaving an unattended item.

### Released

- [Catch as Catch Can][1]
- [The Wall Street Journal][2]
