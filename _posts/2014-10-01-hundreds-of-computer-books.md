title: Hundreds of computer books

Last night, I sorted through the rest of my computer books. Today, I
delivered 52 back issues of Linux Journal magazine, and 108 computer
books.  Somehow, I didn't manage to get pictures of all of them, so
this list is incomplete.

There are some classics in here! [Peter Norton's Programmer's Guide to
the IBM PC][3]! And K&R's [The C Programming Language][4], for instance.

I've read them all---most, cover-to-cover. They really serve no purpose
for me now, though. I had so many computer books, I didn't have shelf
space for them. Some were boxed. Some were stacked on my desk and against
the wall next to the bookshelves behind my desk.

I hope some will benefit some young students. Much of this list is
better suited for an anthropologist, though. They're outdated.

Oh well, they have a new home: [Spokane Valley Tech][1]
