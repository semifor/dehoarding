For years, I've told my wife, "If it doesn't fit in panniers, we don't
need it."

I'm finally trying to live up to that motto. This blog is my attempt to
document the process.

I will be discarding, donating, gifting, and selling many things. Some
will have sentimental value and memories attached. I'll try to record
them here.

Someday, I'd like to lease the house out and go on an extended bike
tour. This is a big step in that direction.
